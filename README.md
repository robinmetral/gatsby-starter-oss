# gatsby-starter-oss

A Gatsby starter to showcase your open-source projects.

## Getting started

### Clone

#### With the Gatsby CLI

```
gatsby new my-gatsby-site https://github.com/robinmetral/gatsby-starter-oss
```

#### On GitHub

Create a new repo from `gatsby-starter-oss` with the GitHub
`Use this template` button, or
[click here](https://github.com/robinmetral/gatsby-starter-oss/generate).

### Add a GitHub token

The starter expects a GitHub token (with `repo` access). The default config expects it in the `GITHUB_TOKEN` [environment variable](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/environment-variables/).

You can simply create a token [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens), add it to the `.env-example` file, rename the file `.env`, and you're ready to go!
